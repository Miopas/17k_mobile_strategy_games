"""Gun Runner is a trading game, inspired by the trading games  on vintage platforms such as Dopewars. \n\nThe basic rules of trading apply. Buy low, sell high. What's cheap in one city may be expensive in another. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing in this world can be very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026\n\nTo make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and that you're getting a good price.

"""Want to stimulate your brain, have fun and relax, all at the same time? Welcome to the world of WORP. Your iPhone now becomes a gaming machine, full of challenge and excitement. Manipulate the colored bits correctly and you take the win. Click \u201c\u2026More\u201d to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n\nTop #8 Game for iPhone 4G (ezinearticles.com)\n\nThe ultimate mind exercise and amusement comes up in a single iPhone application \u2013 WORP (techpeck.com)\n\n\nA profitable gift of concentration for all that love challenge (Carsten Scheibe \u2013 allemeineapps.de)\n\nI hate Solitaire, but this game is really fun to play (bitsundso.de)\n\n\nThis is really fun\n\u201cThe current version runs without problems, the menu is easy to use and totally understandable. The rules are very well explained and the tutorial is short and easy to understand. The game offers both diverting relaxation for small pauses or for bridging a gap between appointments and real challenges for combination skills in the higher levels. Conclusion: real fun!\u201d\n\u2013 obstfreund\n\nGreat little Brain Burner\n\u201eIf you enjoy a good puzzler, WORP is for you. I think the instructions could be a bit clearer, but a game or two will make things click. Very groovy ambient techno soundtrack. Well worth the dough they are asking for it.\u201c\n\u2013 Ortho123\n\nYour brow is furrowed in concentration. So far, you\u2019ve only managed to turn some of the primary bits into combined bits. That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory.\n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game.

"The storm is raging outside the old Victorian mansion where the would-be heirs to the Vile Haberdashery estate have gathered.  The matriarch is dying, and murder is in the air - whoever survives this night will walk away with a fortune!\n\nIn this nasty, conniving, and thoroughly awful multiplayer strategy game, players take on the role of one of the four nobles trying to kill off the others.  Each noble is surrounded by a retinue of leeches, hangers-ons, and sycophants who can be bent to your will through the use of blackmail, flattery, or intimidation.\n\nYour goal is to gain influence over these subordinates, give one of them a weapon, and send them over amidst your opponents.  If you have enough influence over the subordinates, and they have a weapon, they\'ll kill that noble for you, and you\'re one corpse closer to winning the game!\n\nThe game is played in a turn-based fashion, using an innovative ""pass the phone"" style.  Each player takes a turn on the device, and then hands it to the next player to take their turn.  The device is handed around between players until one of them wins.  Audio cues triggered during play give other players clues as to what the current player might be doing, which adds to the intrigue.\n\nThis game may be played by 2 to 4 players, however, because it\'s all played on the same device, you only need one copy of the game to play with your friends.  The casual nature of the game makes it an excellent diversion to play while doing other things - hanging out, watching television, on road trips, waiting for the movie to start, etc.  It\'s a fun game to just pull out and run when you want something casual that engages your friends.\n\nThe original version of this game was created for the 2010 Global Game Jam by a team of 4 people.  This version is a cleaned-up and improved version with new features.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  *  Multiplayer casual strategy for 2-4 players.\n  *  Blackmail, flatter, and intimidate your subordinates to murder your rivals.\n  *  Fun, innovative gameplay that evokes Machiavellian intrigue.\n  *  Casual gameplay makes it ideal for parties, lunch breaks, or just when hanging out."	0

"Funbridge is an online bridge game allowing you to learn and play duplicate bridge wherever and whenever you like.\n \nBridge is a card game played with four people who play as two competing teams of two players called ""pairs"" (North-South and East-West). The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.\n \nOn Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!\n\nOther players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.\n\nFunbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments).

"NINE MEN\'S MORRIS\n\nEach player has nine pieces, or ""men"", which move among the board\'s twenty-four spots. The object of the game is to leave the opposing player with fewer than \nthree pieces or, as in checkers, no legal moves.\n\nPlacing the pieces:\n\nThe game begins with an empty board. Players take turns placing their pieces on empty spots. If a player is able to form a row of three pieces along one of the board\'s lines, \nhe has a ""mill"" and may remove one of his opponent\'s pieces from the board; removed pieces may not be placed again. Players must remove any other pieces first before \nremoving a piece from a formed mill. Once all eighteen pieces have been used, players take turns moving.\n\nMoving the pieces:\n\nTo move, a player slides one of his pieces along a board line to an empty adjacent spot. If he cannot do so, he has lost the game.\nAs in the placement stage, a player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove one of his opponent\'s pieces, avoiding the removal of \npieces in mills if at all possible.\nAny player reduced to two pieces is unable to remove any more opposing pieces and thus loses the game."	0

Sailing at sea might be dangerous, as crowds of pirates attack vessels. Repel an attack by arming the crew, hitting pirates and throwing objects at them. You can move members of the crew across the deck, save them from water and put back on the ship. Make sure that at least one member of the crew is standing on a deck; otherwise pirates will steal the ship. \nYou can choose from 3 difficulty levels, each of them features 4 ships that are unlocked one by one. Your personal achievements are listed in a table of records. \nUse different tactics on different ships. Each member of the crew has their own personality and acts differently (read more on tutorial), so you have to find the most suitable position and weapon for captain, bosun and chef, which differ from level to level. Deck space depends on kind of ship, and on each level there are different types of pirates (read more on tutorial), and each type should be fought using special strategy and the most efficient weapons.\nFeel the atmosphere of a severe battle and help good guys to win. \n\n** use your index finger to play the game, it should help\n** one sailor with pan hardy can bet the pirate, try to regroup your forces\n** you can move not only sailors, but also weapons\n** first level on easy mode should take a couple of minutes to pass\n** second level is a bit harder, because of drunken pirates, but it should take a couple of minutes to pass, after some practice\n** all your comments and support are very essential to us, after a week we are planing first update, which will fix major bugs and misbalance	1

"""Cool Drops is an original tile matching game from Sincereal Media.\nLike a relaxing puzzle/strategy game should be, it's turn-based, with no time limits between turns.\nTiles are dropped into a grid with an oscillating dropper.\nTouch the screen to 'arm' the dropper, slowing it down and turning on the column lights.  Release your finger to drop the tile into the appropriate column.\nThere's a heat meter that accrues heat while you hold your finger down.  If it fills up, you are punished with a full row of tiles rained on the grid from above.\nYou keep the heat meter cool by minimizing your finger hold-down time, and making matches.\nLarge matches are rewarded with a free zap token, which, when used, allows you to remove a tile with no heat penalty.\nTo shake things up, there's a fish that randomly pushes tiles up (with some warning).\n\nThere are six fun songs to choose from, two of which were graciously contributed by Charlie Hunter, famous recording artist."""	1

"Play this fun and easy-to-use Sudoku game on your iPhone or iPad. Great for beginners and a challenge for experts. It has beautiful graphics, smooth game play and subtle sound effects.\n\nSudoku is a number puzzle game where you try to fill in the blanks. Each digit (from 1 to 9) can only appear once in each row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. There is only one solution for each puzzle. Here\'s an example:\n\nIf a row looks like this:\n    1 3 _ 4 5 6 8 9 7\nThen the number 2 is the only possible answer for that empty space, because the numbers 13456789 are all already in that row. By looking to see which numbers are already in a row, column and 3x3 sub-grid you can figure out what numbers go in each cell. (It sounds more complicated than it is! The ""SIMPLE"" level puzzles make it pretty easy to get started.)\n\nIf you love puzzle and card games try my other games too!\n\nDESCRIPTION \n\nEric\'s Sudoku has 5 difficulty levels of puzzles from SIMPLE to EXPERT.

"THIS IS A COMPANION APP, TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ZOMBICIDE BOARDGAME BY GUILLOTINE GAMES.\n\nZombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts from 20min (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board).\n\nEach player controls from one to four ""survivors"", human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, ""survivors"" hastily change to ""hunters"" to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide\'s going on, the ""Danger level"" is going up and the infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster.\nZombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between ""beat\'em up"" and ""survival horror"" as characters keep on turning from prey to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest.\n\nThe Zombicide Companion App serves as a digital replacement for the Survival Identity Cards used in the boardgame to keep track of each character\u2019s equipment inventory, experience and skills. But the app goes beyond that, offering players some cool extra aids as well.\n\n\u2013 Features \u2013 \n\u2022 A virtual deck of equipment cards allows you to easily control you survivors inventory, switching cards around with a flick of the wrist and no fear of cards slipping around.\n\n\u2022 Keeping track of your survivor\u2019s experience has never been easier. Add XP by ticking off what zombies you killed and your Danger Bar is automatically updated.\n\n\u2022 As you gain experience and new Danger Levels, your new Skill options are automatically displayed, and the app incorporates any pertinent new game effects.\n\n\u2022 Having a hard time keeping track of your actions as you gain new free ones? With the Action Bar, you can tick off each specific action as you take it, so you always know what actions you have left.\n\n\u2022 Roll virtual dice for any of your equipped weapons, automatically calculating successful hits according to any combat skills you may have (and with sound effects to boot!)\n\n\u2022 Choose any of the Survivor characters, including the promos. Up to 6 Survivors can be managed on the same device.\n\nGuillotine Games\nhttp://guillotinegames.com"	0

The puzzle fills the entire screen and the numbers are large enough to see from a distance. The text is crystal clear and looks especially crisp on retina displays. During gameplay, the puzzle board is never covered by menus or gimmicky animations.\n\nGESTURES AND TAPS IMPROVE GAMEPLAY\n\nSudo uses gestures and taps to cut down on visual clutter and speed up gameplay. To start a new puzzle, simply swipe to turn the page. If there's only one possibility left for a square, double-tap it to set it as the answer. When a number is completed on the board, its button is disabled to prevent accidental taps.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PUZZLES\n\nSudo comes with a nearly unlimited supply of Sudoku puzzles and five different difficulty levels. No need to buy new puzzle packs \u2013 it's all included!\n\nINTELLIGENT DIFFICULTY RATINGS\n\nComputers are good at solving Sudoku puzzles but bad at determining their true difficulty. Sudo evaluates each puzzle as a human would and divides them into five difficulties ranging from Easy to Insane. Easy puzzles are great for first-timers, and Insane puzzles are amongst the hardest in the world.\n\nIN-GAME GUIDE TEACHES YOU NEW TECHNIQUES\n\nUse the built-in guide to improve your game or to get out of a bind. If you get stuck in the middle of a puzzle, Sudo will clear your mistakes or walk you through your next move step by step. The hints system has been designed from the ground up to help teach players how to get better, not just give them answers. Learn techniques such as X-Wing, Finned Jellyfish, Avoidable Rectangles, and many more."""	1

Just stuff a sheep or ram with a heap of poisonous filth and feed it to a dragon. Of course it\'s not the most heroic method but it is very safe and effective. \n\nAnother option is to announce a reward for the dragon\u2019s head. After that the only thing you have to do is wait while the army of heroes, wizards and freaks drive a monster to its grave. It is always necessary to find a solution to the dragon problem because all the members of this scale-winged tribe have the same disease. It is a strong allergy to humans and their settlements and all dragons use the only medicine against this illness; total annihilation of the humans. \n\nTroubles with dragons are in the forefront of \u201cMajesty: The Northern Expansion\u201d. Of course you\u2019ll have to defend your kingdom from the other evil spawns, for example how about the giant stone golems that have an outstanding amount of hit points? Expanding the territory of your kingdom and starting the northern expansion in the land of the frost and winter you\u2019ll have to rack you brains over the riddle of fire-spitting monsters.\n\nAll who liked the original mobile game \u201cMajesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim\u201d will undoubtedly be pleased by its add-on \u201cMajesty: The Northern Expansion\u201d which gives an opportunity for players to continue their conquest in a new snowy location.\n\n\u201cMajesty: The Northern Expansion\u201d - it\u2019s time to feed the dragons!\n\nGame features: \n\n- New missions and new location \u2013 Northern Lands\n- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for mobile platforms\n- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armor\n- New monsters\n- Changeable weather conditions\n- Skirmish mode \n\n______________________________________ \n\nFOLLOW US: @Herocraft \nWATCH US: youtube.com/herocraft \nLIKE US: facebook.com/herocraft.games\n______________________________________ \n\n\u201cMajesty: The Northern Expansion\u201d is a trademark of Paradox Interactive. \nDeveloped and published under license by Herocraft."	0

3D Real-time strategy with simple controls, units assembly, attractive graphics, upgrade system and challenging AI.\n\n=== Story ===\nIt is the year 2100 and Earth is rapidly running out of resources. In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!\n \n=== Description ===\nMechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It\u2019s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune. It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.\n\n=== How To Play ===\nGameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example. Once you create your army, you can converge on the map to take control of Beacons where you can deploy more units. Capturing and keeping Beacons is vital in making your way across the map. Engage and eliminate all opponent units and structures to be declared the victor. \n\n=== Game Features ===\n\u2022  Basic Tutorial.\n\u2022  Challenging AI.\n\u2022  Simple 3D graphics.\n\u2022  7 Ranks to progress though.\n\u2022  Simple large touch controls.\n\u2022  12 maps set in 3 different landscapes.\n\u2022  NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES EVER!\n\u2022  Old-school resources collection system.\n\u2022  2 game modes (Ranked Game and Custom Game).\n\u2022  16 unique combinations of mechs PLUS UPGRADES!\n\n=== Game Tips ===\n\u2022  Strongest is not always best.\n\u2022  Upgrades and key to victory.\n\u2022  Hover chassis can go over water and works great for scouts.\n\u2022  Speed is important. Build as fast and as efficiently as you can.\n\u2022  Capture and keep as many Beacons as you can for the advantage.\n\u2022  Collect as many minerals as you can before the enemy collects them all.	1

"Succeed in an uncertain world with your Judgement!\n\nJudgement challenges your ability to judge correctly in a continuously changing environment. Round after round, things are never the same, and as the uncertainties mount your will to succeed keeps getting stronger.\n\nThis engaging game measures, quantifies and reports your ability to predict the outcome of an uncertain round of card game. Use this game as a source of entertainment and as a tool to evaluate your tendency to act in uncertainties of your personal and professional lives. Use the scoreboard of this game as a data point to understand whether you are too aggressive or too conservative when it comes to risk taking. Sharpen your memory as you note and remember cards played by other players to continuously refine your strategy in every play.\n\nJudgement is played in many parts of the world under different names and slight variations! It first appeared in London and New York in the 1930s with the original name of ""Oh Hell!"". The original name offended some people and has been bowdlerized in many books to ""Oh Pshaw!"" or ""Oh Well!"". Some call it ""Blob"" or ""Blackout"", perhaps because of the practice of recording a player\'s bid on the scoreboard and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player failed to win correct number of hands. The game is known as ""l\'Ascenseur"" in France, ""Up and Down the River"" or ""Bust"" in Australia and New Zealand, ""10 op en need"" or ""Boerenbridge"" in the Netherlands, ""Nomination Whist"" in the UK, and ""German Bridge"" in Hong Kong. The game is extremely popular as ""Judgement"" in India."	0

"Introducing PlunderChess\xae\u2026 \n\nIf Chess is fun (and it is!) then PlunderChess\xae is EXPONENTIALLY FUN!\nImagine playing chess like you always do, however, this time, upon making a capture, the chess piece doing the kill is then allowed to ""take on"" added moving capabilities directly from its spoils, and use those newly acquired capabilities on one future move!... henceforth.... you have PLUNDERCHESS\xae!  You will quickly be hooked!\n\nFeatures of PlunderChess\xae App:\n1) Colored Vests overlaying 2D chess pieces to indicate plundered powers.\n2) Practice board to build strategies and enhance your tactics.\n3) Analysis board to test active game piece maneuvers.\n4) Supports both Live and Turn Based 2-player action.\n5) Rankings System in leaderboard.\n6) Audible and text chat with your opponent.\n\nOptions for 2-Player Play (AI coming):\n1) ""Turn Based""...This option is RECOMMENDED for MOST of your play.  After connecting with your opponent, it allows you to make your move, then close out of app only to return after being notified when it is your turn again.\n2) ""Real Time""...This option should be used when you and your opponent are ready to play through an entire game in one sitting.\n\nYouTube:\nCheck out our YouTube video clips\u2026. enter: plunderchess in the search field.\n\nRead what others are saying about the PlunderChess\xae board game:\n1)  Cathi, Editor for NY State Empire Chess Magazine\u2026Product Review\u2026\n\u201cThis is an amazing and exciting new game which takes off from the regular game of chess using a regular chess board.  We discovered it at the famous USATE Tournament, brought it home, and it has become a favorite game at home, and among chess fans at our local chess club\u2026.\u201d\n\n2)  Becca, 12 year old student writes\u2026\n\u201cMy family and i love plunderchess!! it is the best ever!! we\'re always playing it! I used 2 dread it when my family played chess bc 2 me it was boring. but PLUNDERchess, now thats another story. its easy to understand and FUN!\u201d\n\nHere are a few of the BASIC Rules of PlunderChess\xae Play:\n1) ""Plundering"" occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing piece and ""plunders"" or ""acquires"" additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured, hence, strengthening the capturing piece!  This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called ""vests"") on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.\n\n2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it\'s very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)\n\n3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a ""trade"") and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)\n\n4) When plundering is elected, a ""colored vest banner"" that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move."	1

Your own motorcycle club. Break the rules! Join the game!\nThe most exciting online game - now available on your iOS-Device\n\nGame-Intro:\n\nBack then, three years ago, I was making good business, mainly firearms. A bit of extortion, a couple girls.\nAll on a pretty good scale. In those days, I had it all! But then I got too careless and the ATF raided my crib.\nLuckily, they didn\u2019t have too much evidence against me. Still, that mess brought me three years in Rikers Island.\nDuring a yard exercise, a guy tried to knife the president of the Bastards of Hell.\nUsually, of course, the first rules in the slammer are: Don\u2019t see, don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t tell. And most importantly, don\u2019t get involved.\nBut the MC guys were honest types. You could count on them. I guess that was why I didn\u2019t just turn my head.\nNow the MC owed me. They promised that if I needed my own territory in New York after I got out, they would get me one.\nI guess I could a joined the MC, but I preferred doing my own thing. Still, the whole appearance of the MC really impressed me.\n\nI\u2019ve been riding a chopper since I can remember. So why not start my own MC?	0

The game starts with a 10\xd710 board with three balls chosen out of seven different colours. \n     The player can move one ball per turn, and the player may only move a ball to a particular place if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells) between the current position of the ball and the desired destination. \n     The goal is to remove balls by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five balls of the same colour. \n     If the player does form such lines of at least five balls of the same colour, the balls in those lines disappear, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another ball. \n     If not, three new balls are added, and the game continues until the board is full.	0

"Partia 2 is a SRPG (Strategy Role-playing) video game inspired by Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series. In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 2 : The Pretenders War is a sequel to Partia: The Broken Lineage. The game packs 22 stages that could present challenges to any SRPG fan.\n\nPartia 2 introduces many new features, including the choice of ""Common turn"" rule where all factions make moves alternatively (like Chess) instead of taking turns to move all his/her units. I believe this will bring a new nuance to gameplay if a player choose to do so. It can be toggled in intermission, and you can always play the game in the traditional FE way. (Common turn idea is from Berwick Saga) AI had improved a lot, and horse units now can move after attacking, if they have remaining move distances. \n\nRegrettably, the game could not deliver large animation battle. If you felt the game looked bad in Partia 1, then you\'ll find this game look much the same, except we have much bigger and nicer character portraits. It is because original Partia was never profitable, making Partia 2 production running on fume. (It sold around 6000 copies in two years) The stress of not getting paid almost broke our team of two, but somehow sheer will allowed this game to be out here for you. So whether this game series is success or not, I am immensely proud of the results. How many five year projects can a person do in a life time? ;-) Many times I was tempted to include some IAP stuff into the game and get cheap dollar or two, but I decided against it. More than anything, I rather have this game to be remembered as good, than have that IAP distaste.\n\nSo you may refrain from purchasing this game if you didn\'t like Partia 1. But I promise you it will be a much better experience (and much more challenging) if you did enjoy the original Partia.\n\nThank you all, and please let us know what you think!"	1

In 2014 the game took first place among Board games for iPhone in Russia and Ukraine!!!\n\nTwo fleets meet in deadly opposition. Only the prudent mind and tactical skills of the best admiral can declare an unconditional victory. The ships conduct warfare by attacking blindly, filling all water area by means of shells. Such conditions create a practical boundless scope for tactics and strategy.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThis is a mobile rendition of our classic childhood game Sea Battle.

Rules are simple and easy to follow. On a game field each player has ships, from foreboding battle ships to small boats. Opponents in turn fire across the field of the opponent, clicking on the corresponding boxes that represent the open waters.

Let's face it, you could hardly do a worse job than our current political leaders. Crime, Unemployment, National Debt, Terrorism, Climate Change...Have you got the answers to the problems that face western industrialized nations? Here is your chance to find out\u2026\n\nAn entire virtual country\n\nDemocracy 3 simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. A custom-designed neural network is used to model individual voters, each which varying memberships of voting groups, political parties and pressure groups. Each voters income is modelled, along with their levels of complacency and cynicism. This is the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created.\n\nUnique user interface\n\nDespite being vastly detailed under-the-hood, Democracy 3 has a unique user interface that makes visualising the connections between laws, policies, voters and situations easy. A simple iconic-based view of your countries issues allows you to 'drill-down' through all the relationships between policies and voters to quickly analyse the impacts of your decisions. Your trade policy may affect GDP, which will affect unemployment, which will effect poverty, and thus crime, leading to a change in tourism, which affects GDP\u2026\n\nComplex simulated voters\n\nEach individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example. Not only this, but the extent to which they identify each of those groups is both variable, and can be affected by your policies in the long term. Convert your country to religion, or atheism, to capitalism, or socialism by careful and nuanced adjustment of your policies and laws over time. A 'focus group' feature lets you look at individual voters and see exactly how they came to a decision to vote for you (or not!).\n\nDetailed policy model\n\nEach policy (or law) in the game has a slider which allows you to fine tune it's intensity to get the balance just right. A series of equations within the game allows the same policy to have radically different effects on each voter group at different points in the slider, so some voters may be indifferent to a policy unless it reaches extreme levels, for example. Democracy 3 also models the global economy, including credit rating agencies and debt interest levels, as well as the impact of global events on your country."""	0

"""Castleclysm (noun) - A Tower Defense of any absurd upheaval, especially one of a dramatic social or political nature occurring within a castle interior.\n\nSo there\u2019s a big Castle, a bunch of really angry peasants, a very irresponsible King, and some out-of-place Magic Casters. Come on! How bad could it be?\n\nIn this unique Tower Defense, embark on a medieval journey of many tales: An insolent King, a grand Castle, angry peasants, and the Magic Casters that find themselves in bizarre situations.

Do everything you can! Defend yourself with the Castle's many valuable objects--treasure chests, chandeliers, the King's throne and more \u2014 or conjure your many crowd sweeping spells to rid the hall of different types of intruders that want you gone!

Utilizing chickens to fly or strapping explosives to blow themselves up, the intruders are cunning and desperate. You must be crafty and resourceful to survive. Your abilities will be tested!\n\n- TALES OF THE MANY\nPlay as different magical characters, each with their own dramatic tale!

Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\n\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\nConnect with Facebook and Game Center friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\n\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\n\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\n\nPro tip: You can move your buildings when they are not upgrading or damaged - just tap and hold then move to a free captured tile!\n\nPlease Note:\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

At dawn on June 18th, the torrential rain which had soaked the Belgium countryside the previous day began tapering off. Seventy thousand French troops, constituting the bulk of Napoleon\u2019s Armee du Nord, which two days earlier had vanquished the Prussian Army of the Rhine at Ligney, now expected to exploit their initial victory by destroying the unsupported and inexperienced Anglo-Dutch forces which the Duke of Wellington had deployed across the Brussels-Charleroi highway a few miles south of the inconsequential hamlet called Waterloo.\n\nThat morning at his headquarters in Le Caillou, Napoleon discussed the impending battle with his subordinates while awaiting the arrival of several French Corps which had bivouacked further south. Disagreeing with the French generals whom Wellington had consistently defeated in Spain, Napoleon insisted that his opponent was a poor commander and that the English troops were much inferior to the French. The battle which Napoleon envisioned would resemble \u2018le petit dejeuner\u2019, Wellington\u2019s army would be devoured as easily as a light continental breakfast.\n\n- Historically accurate game play.\n- 7 missions including\n  \t- Quatre Bras\n  \t- Hougomont\n  \t- La Haye Sainte\n  \t- Plancenoit\n  \t- Waterloo\n- Accurate Napoleonic Units;\n- Five categories of unit quality.\n- Different types of formations.\n- Detailed combat analysis.\n- In-depth reference charts.\n- Advanced tactical features including:\n  \t- Map zoom.\n  \t- Strategic movement.\n  \t- Flank attacks.\n  \t- Low Ammo.\n- Hours of Gameplay.\n\n\xa9 2015 HexWar Games Ltd.\n\xa9 2015 Decision Games, Inc\n\xa9 2015 Lordz Games Studio s.a.r.l.\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nPlease note this games runs best on iPhone 5S+ and iPad 3+	0

"Hundreds of thousands of people made Theseus one of the top selling puzzle games in the app store in the past. Theseus has been updated with all new graphics and 100 new levels.\n\nThis iOS app is bundled with the Apple TV app!  Take Theseus on the go or play in your living room!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nReviews for Theseus:\n\n""With a set of superb levels and the kind of gameplay that can entice you for either hourly marathons or quick-minute fixes, Theseus is easily one of the best puzzlers available, and that\'s no myth."" --Pocketgamer: 9/10 Gold Award\n\n* ""This may be the best game I have purchased so far.""\n\n* ""This app is one of the few gems around the app store.""\n\n* ""Challenging, highly addictive, but also easy to take out and play in small chunks of time, this is the perfect mobile app game.""\n\n* ""The game is extremely awesome and fun to play. Unlike many other games this was actually worth the money I had paid to obtain it.""\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBased on an original concept from puzzle-master Robert Abbott, Theseus is a refreshing twist on the traditional maze. As Theseus, you must reach the exit of the labyrinth while avoiding the terrible Minotaur. The Minotaur takes two steps for every one of yours, but follows a strict set of rules that you can use to outsmart him.\n\nThe Theseus game engine provides complete control over move history, allowing you to undo all moves. You\'ll need it, since outmaneuvering the Minotaur can be quite a difficult task.

Two worlds with  60 different levels. 120 levels in total! Each world contains several mines with varied and interesting powers (explosive mine, freezing mine, ticking mine, bubble mine,...)\n\nIn this minesweeper puzzles, you have several levels and it\'s a great challenge to find all the mines ! \n\nTo clear a mine, simply touch and hold your finger on the tile that you think to be a mine. To win, you can also break all the other tiles, avoiding mines. Each land contains the explosive mine and a specific mine.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS WORLDS\n-------------------------------------\nClimb around the ""Upside-down"" world and visit the four lands:\n- The jungle and greenery mines\n- The icy world and freezing mines\n- The pink world and the lost memory mines\n- The dark world and ticking mines\n\nNavigate underwater without having to end the first world:\n- The kingdom of the giant crab and bubble mines\n- The sleeping octopus with mini octopus mines\n- The secretive clams\n- The white explosing mines\n\nREWARDS\n--------------------\nGet each day reward of gold bars or power!

You can also get free gold bars watching a video.\n\nAt each achievement you do, you receive free gold bars (eg first level, 5th level, 3 straight victory ...)\n\nAIDS\n-------------------------\nDuring the game, with the gold bars, you can use helpers (at the bottom left of the game screen). These aids are really useful when you are stranded in the game. The aids are filled automatically when you pop free squares.\n\nThe first aid targets a free space and pop it. The second puts some magic powder on several free tiles that you can pop safely. The last and most powerful displays for a few seconds the location of all mines.\n\nTUTORIAL:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA tutorial is available to help you to understand how to play. Bellow a detailed explanation of the minesweeper game:\n\nThe goal is to clear a minefield without detonating the mines. You see first a grid of identical squares. Some random and unknown squares contain a mine.\n\nThe game is played by revealing squares of the grid by touching them with your finger. \n\nIf a square containing a black mine is revealed, you lose the game. If a square containing a special mine is revealed, the mine explodes and handicaps are added to the grid, for example, filling the already discovered squares.\n\nIf a free square is revealed, a number appears in this square with the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. If this number is zero then the square appears empty, and the surrounding squares are automatically revealed. Using logic, you can in many case use these numbers to deduce the locations of mines or free squares. In case of mine, you can protect the square and capture a mine by adding a flag with a long touch on the screen.\n\nThe game is won when all squares containing mines are located and protected with a flag. In this case, the unrevealed squares are automatically revealed and the next level unlocked.\n\nThe game contains many levels in different worlds. The first levels are easy, but the difficulty increases gradually as the game advances. Each world contains a different special mine. A grid contains black mines, special mines or both.\n\nMoreover you have a limited number of moves available to find all the mines. \n\nIf you have no more live, you can invite Facebook friends to play and you receive a life back! Go in option Menu to use the invite button, or wait to have 0 life.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch , you can play Minesweeper on! Discreet and fun!\n\nGood luck on your trip!"	1

"Economic simulation on mars!\n\nMars is known as the Red Planet. But this is going to change in Mars Tomorrow. Humans inhabited the once hostile to life planet and took care of turning it into a green and habitable place. By terraforming, Mars is becoming a planet for the new Martians.\nFrom red to green\n\nIn the game Mars Tomorrow your aim is the colonizing the planet in order to transform it into a green planet. The player takes the role of a brave colonist. With the Earth being anything but habitable, the player has to try his luck as a Martian. The settlement project is called Mars Tomorrow and is the beginning of the operation \u2018Life on Mars\u2019 and let you start colonizing Mars with other new Martians.\nThe birth of their own colony\n\nHowever, general living conditions are hardly met on Mars as it is. The red planet seems to be bleak and arid - not even grass grows in the dreary wasteland. At the beginning of your mission you need to gather resources, which are urgently needed for the colonization of Mars. These include water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Once this is done, all the raw materials are used to produce vital products. The Mars Rovers take care of the transportation to the colony, which will grow over time. As your colony grows, more and more people will decide to settle on Mars. The new residents of the colony help in increasing the colony and a thriving economy will soon be established. Once the economy grows, greenhouse gases are emitted, forming an Earth-like atmosphere. The resulting clouds, rain, rivers, lakes and algae enable the transformation of a formerly red to a green planet.\nProspering economy\n\nAt first glance, Mars Tomorrow appears as a simple building game. However, with increasing population comes a significant increase in the challenges of the economic simulation part of the game. All tasks must be coordinated, so that the economy does not collapse and the survival of the population can be ensured. Once the Mars Rover brought the resources to the colony, terraforming is performed. The larger the population, the more resources are needed. The player is faced with the question: How to master both, economic and environmental difficulties. At first, every Martian only controls a few Mars Rovers, which can be improved by ""plug-ins"". The Mars itself changes every ten days, so the player is faced with many new challenges. Overall, there are eight phases that ultimately give the planet its green appearance and enabling Earth-like conditions on Mars. In each phase, there is also a new type of vehicle.\nTogether for a better life\n\nLife on Mars is not designed by a player alone, but together with several players to experience and enjoy the game together, which makes the game very communicative. Certain resources supply the player Terra points. At the end of a round they will be compared with the points of the other players. The player with the highest Terra point score wins the round. However, not only the winner of a round receives a goodie. The best players of each round will be able to win Tritium, which will be added directly into their account at the beginning of the new round. In the world of Mars Tomorrow Tritium is eventually used to buy settlers accounts, plug-ins and much more. All rounds in \u201cFree to Play\u201d-mode are nonviolent."	0

This version of my app feature the 1-on-1 solo game with three level of difficulty.\nThe game is made of 36 cards (3, 4, 5, 6, Q, J, K , 7, A of each suit). Their values are in that order. However, when counting to see who won, 3, 4, 5, 6 all have a value of 0. Q, J, K, 7, A are the only ones that count towards winning. Thus, you want to collect as many of those as you possibly can. Their values are 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 respectively. \n\nThe card with it\'s face up under the deck is call the trump card. Fun fact: trump card means ""Iturufu (pronounced E-too-roo-foo)"" in Kinyarwanda (language spoken in Rwanda)., hence the name of the game. I.E. Amaturufu can be thought of as a card game of many trump cards since each game has its own trump card, which is, most of the times, different than the previous or next games\'.\n\nAnyway, if someone plays a card of the same suit as the trump card while the other player plays a card from a different suit, the player who played the card of the same suit as the trump card wins that play and collects both cards. Otherwise, if both cards are of the same suit, the player who played the card with the highest value wins that play and collects both cards. Finally, if none of the cards is of the same suit as the trump card and they are of different suits, the player who played the first card (the bottom card) wins that play and collects both cards.\n\nThe player who wins a play goes first the next play.\n\nHappy playing!\nDon\'t hesitate to let us know how we can improve your experience."	1

The year is 1989.  You are President of the United States in transforming times. After forty years of oppression, the people of Eastern Europe are daring to defy their Communist overlords at home and in the Soviet Union. And as President, you too face daring decisions: how far will you go to encourage democratic reform? How much will you risk a Soviet crackdown on these freedom-seeking peoples? Will your efforts help bring democracy to Eastern Europe, or will you provoke the Soviet Union to bring down its wrath, setting the cause of freedom back by decades? \n\nThis is a strategy game about presidential decision-making in the context of the Bush 41 presidency in those epochal years of 1989 and 1990. As Poland legalizes Solidarity, as the Berlin Wall falls, as people in every country take to the streets seeking greater freedom and human rights, the world is changing under your feet. As President, you must analyze changing situations, weigh risks, and make decisions, all while trying to keep your alliances healthy, your relationships with foreign leaders strong, and the drive towards freedom and democracy always moving forward. And in the end, you can compare your successes and failures with those of President Bush 41. \n\n\u201cCold War Dare\u201d is an educational outreach product by the George Bush Presidential Library.\n\nCredits:\nDirected and produced by Dr. Shirley Hammond, Director of Education, George Bush Presidential Library and Museum \xa9 2016, George Bush Presidential Library Foundation \n\nGame design and development by eduweb. \n\nThanks to: \nDr. Jeffrey A.

"""This game is happening around 500 - 300 B.C when there were clash of Greeks and Romans. You as a warlord of Roman and need to protect, upgrade and create a war strategy to put a stand against the marching Greece enemies. Story revolves around one of the fantasy history about these titan quest, evolution and fight.\n\nThey have game like Olympic style games in Greece, while Gladiatorial games were played in Rome. Every citizens most enjoyable time is when these games are running like a festival season.\n\nCreate a Roman type strategy.\nDefend your Roman area and people from marching enemies.\nPlan to take a strong stand against attack from Air, Land and Water.\nUpgrade your war machinery regularly.\nPower from Gods like thunder to fight against titans and warlords.\nUse coins to purchase more weapons and upgrades.\n\nAncient civilization had unique culture, gods, war type, society, treating women, slaves and art styles.\n\nThe ancient Roman and Greek civilizations had well-organized political processes that greatly influenced the manner in which later governments were structured in Europe and the United States. The system of political parties, the establishment of divisions in government -- even political words such as democracy, monarchy and tyranny originated in ancient Rome and Greece. Although Rome drew many of its political principles from the Greeks, and as a result, developed a government similar to that of Greece, there were several differences between the two.\n\nGreeks built roads to connect two specific cities. Romans built roads that connected their empire to Rome. This is the location of this addictive game.\n\nSome of the popular Greek God Vs Roman Gods names\nZeus : Jupiter\nPoseidon : Neptune\nDionysus: Bacchus\nHades : Dis Pater, Pluto, Orcus\nAres : Mars\nHermes : Mercury\nEros : Cupid (Amor)\n\nBoth are Mediterranean countries, similar enough latitudinal for both to grow wine and olives, but with very different terrain. The ancient Greek city-states were separated from each other by hilly countryside and all were near the water. on the other hand Rome was inland, on one side of the Tiber River, but the Italic tribes (in the boot-shaped peninsula that is now Italy) did not have the natural hilly borders to keep them out.\n\nIn Ancient Greece women had no rights.  They were property. While in Rome, under the king and in the republic, women were not property, still they had no equal rights.  During the Empire, Roman women had quite a few rights, but were still not citizens.\n\nThe armies of Republican Rome were strongly rooted in the Italian peasantry.  Rome's political reach was broader than comparable Greek states and military service obligations extended farther down the social scale. This made for a large army with a lot of rural soldiers: people who were used to the outdoor life, familiar with manual labor, and self sufficient.\n\nGreek city state armies tended to be more upper class affairs: the extreme example being Sparta, where the entire army was drawn from the privileged class of Spartiates; but even at Athens there was a lot of tension between the relatively well off hoplite class of landowners and prosperous city folk and the thetes - the urban  working class who could not afford their own armor and were relegated to the rowing benches of the navy. (Note the the Macedonians during their heyday had a much broader base among rural peasants, more on the Roman model).\n\nOver time both Greek and Roman armies professionalized, but in different ways.  After the classical period many Greek armies relied heavily on mercenaries, which provided some impressive technical skills and specialties, but also political unreliability.  Roman armies became more professional as the Italian peasantry was displaced in the late Republic by huge slave-run plantations: the military revolutions of generals like Caesar and Pompey were made easier as soldiering became a lifelong career instead of a short-service civic duty."""	0

"http://www.TrumpsGame.com\n\nA political satire, in the reimaging of the classic game of Tetris. The user plays as the presidential candidate, Donald Trump, as he tries to fulfill his campaign\'s promise of building a beautiful wall along the US border with Mexico. But it won\'t be easy. Donald Trump\'s foes, such as Crooked Hillary, Barack Obama, Vincent Fox, ISIS terrorists, and many others, try to deter him from completing his great wall. However, you can count on special game pieces, gameplay strategies, and the help of Rush Limbaugh with his ""Rush-Nuke"" to assist in Trump\'s Wall. \n\nGreat Wall of Trump, is a different kind of gameplay. First and foremost, it is patriotic and made in pixel art retro-game style.  The player finds the 4 commands easy to use and the overall the game is challenging and surprisingly entertaining. The game is staged in four cities and Donald Trump uses a crane to build a wall as quickly as possible before bombs (molotov bottles, dynamites, or cannon bombs) are thrown to destroy Trump\'s Wall. \n\nTrump\'s wall is an expression of American individualism and exceptionalism. It is about keeping a USA identity and Making America Great Again.  The game idea came about after Donald Trump\'s campaign made it clear that he wants to put America First by securing and preserving it. Mr. Trump is going against all odds, globalism, the media, republicans and democrats alike, the status quo, and crony capitalism in becoming president."	1

"NOTE: This is the \'lite\' version of Primus. The full version contains a mate puzzle generator, many more difficulty levels, puzzles, pieces and boards.\n\nA more human chess engine.\n\nPrimus is an entirely original, modern chess engine specifically designed for the intermediate player (up to 2000 Elo). It has been carefully tuned to play less like a machine and more like a human. At lower levels, it makes blunders of a straightforward kind that are easy to spot, but at higher levels more careful play is required to take advantage of more subtle tactical and even strategic errors. At its highest levels, Primus plays at around 2000 Elo, but even at the very highest levels, it still has occasional simulated lapses of concentration.\n\nThe engine was conceived out of frustration with the overwhelming tactical strength of modern chess engines. Most modern chess engines are so tactically strong that extremely careful defensive and anti-computer play is required to make any progress; in other words, it\'s nothing like playing a human. We wanted to create an engine that allows for a more human, strategic style of play where there\'s room to take advantage of the occasional blunder.\n\nWe\'ve included multiplayer modes that allow you to use your device as a virtual chessboard, or play via bluetooth or wireless with a local opponent.\n\nFeatures in this ""lite"" version include:\n\n- Two player mode over Bluetooth / Lan.\n- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\n- Five different skill levels from total novice to expert (21 in the full version)\n- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.\n- Supports multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.\n- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.\n- Five selected puzzles and practice levels (30 in the full version), so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.\n- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.\n- Elo rating estimation from your game results."	0

Author unknown ***\n\n\u2026the sun scorched our world and left behind ruins of sand, consumed by war and time. And thus we journeyed into the void, aimlessly wandering for peace and a second chance at life.\n\nThe galaxy eventually forgave our sins, sheltered us beneath the warmth of a thousand other suns, and fed us its planetary wonders. But it never once forgot our true nature.\n\nYears of hardships brought widespread discontent among the now scattered human colonies. The sky had given us hope for a new home\u2026but soon hope turned into greed, greed into hate, and hate into war. The Faction Wars, we called them. \n\nViolent in-fighting pushed us to the galaxy\u2019s limits, and to ours. They were waiting for us there. We paid no heed to them, the foolish man looking at his finger pointing at the moon. They paid no heed to us, the mighty gods uninterested in the bickering of ants.\n\nLeft to our own devices, we reunited once again under two unwavering banners: us, the Terrans and\u2026us once again, the Alterians. Only humans, divided by an invisible, impossible mountain. Terrans, all so resourceful, raised from sweat and grease yet always gazing at the line beyond the horizon. Alterians\u2026elegant, advanced, beautiful\u2026yet so eerily obsessed with the dream of otherworldly perfection.\n\nThe last two Houses of Man grew distant, as resentful brothers in a perennial fight over which family path to thread on. Never-ending expansion and gorging of resources, or rejection of human blemishes in pursuit of unachievable divinity? We chose the first and as first we stroke. We ransacked and pillaged whole worlds, and not once did we feel the burden of guilt. And now, Alterians\u2019 inhuman wrath unfolds before my eyes. As honorable and just as they sure are, never had their reaction been so vicious. \n\nI wonder as I gaze into the sky, knowing that this planet will soon be no more. No matter from which side you\u2019ll unfold the events to come, I beg you: unite mankind again, annihilate those who stand in the way, and free us from our ancestral shackles. But most of all, I beg you forgiveness for the man I once was.\n\nMay the horizon never look so broken again.\n\n*** End of transmission ***	1

"""After Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina, fell to the Union, in early 1865, Jefferson Davis belatedly handed over the supreme command or the army to General Lee.

For most of the next week, the Union army pursued the Confederates along the Appomattox River, exhausting any chance of escape.

Yumak is a logic puzzle game in terms of chance factor minimized to the initial shuffling of nodes and the rest completely relies on the player\u2019s thinking ability. Every button/node has a target place (row and column it belongs to) on 2D NxN  matrix indicated by a hole and a rope attached to it. The player solves the puzzle by placing every node to its place by making swaps with other nodes in given time/moves.\n\nWhile a swap can be horizontal and vertical, strategic depth comes from swapping two nodes cause in-between nodes to swap also, so placing the nodes one by one to their original places will not work in most cases because of move/time limit configured to promote use of in-between swapping functionality in order to win stages, i.e. making moves that solve more than two nodes at once and planning for remaining moves encouraged.	1

"""Make your stamp on the worlds of our Solar System!\n\nWorld of Hex is a game of strategy played on a board as big as our solar system where the populated areas of the worlds are divided into hexagonal tiles, and each of those tiles is a game board \u2014 with a state that is alive in the cloud.\n\nWhen you play a game within a tile, that tile stays as you left it until either you, or another player, chooses to play there too.\n\nSo you can claim territory by playing and winning, but you don\u2019t only play for yourself; you also play for your faction.\n\nWhat happens when you aren\u2019t playing?  What happens to the territory you\u2019ve claimed?  Well, you have an AI that will defend it for you.\n\nWhen you start playing, your AI will only know a couple of commands, however as you build up more XP and level-up, you\u2019ll be able to configure your AI to do more, and defend your territory with more ability.  After some play, you will earn the ability to program your AI.\n\nIf you like a strategy, turn based game, then World of Hex is both simple to play but world-spanning in its scope.\n\nPlease note that World of Hex makes use of iCloud and as such, requires you to be logged into iCloud on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.\n\nGame Story:\nSociety as we know it has failed.\n\nThanks to flawed political systems, global warming, and the reckless exploitation of resources, all of the old boundaries and loyalties are gone.\n\nWe live in a world where everyone belongs to one of four factions who are constantly vying for control over the Solar System.\n\nHumanities colonies have been divided into world tiles.  Control over these world tiles is contested by members of each faction.\n\nThis is where you come in.  The more often you play, the more you can do for your faction.  Your faction needs you!\n\nEach world tile is further broken into territories. Control of a tile is achieved by ensuring that your faction controls the most territory within the tile.\n\nTerritory is claimed by building settlements that influence the surrounding territory.  Enemies can threaten you, and overwhelm you if you don't defend effectively.\n\nSettlements can be reinforced either by building them up, or spreading out and taking neighboring territory.\n\nv2.0 and later versions of the game support an alternate story behind the game, though the game play is the same.  For fans of The Expanse\u2122, there are a number of optional visual elements that have been added.  These are available via the themes button once you have access to your AI. Please note that these visual elements are provided as a tribute to The Expanse\u2122 and in no way represent an offical endorsement of World of Hex."""	0

"""Your goal is to build an empire consisting of multiple planets. To do this you will need to procure three vital resources: metal, crystal, and deuterium. Initially, you will mine your home planet for these, using them to build up your infrastructure, research new technologies, and build spacecraft.\n\nThis game offers a variety of play styles. Miners produce their own resources by building mines on their planets and colonies.

Most players combine multiple elements in their personal playstyle.\n\nAs a new player, you have a degree of protection from larger players called Noob Protection. During this period, you can attack and be attacked only by other new players of similar rank.

This game takes place in this re imagining of history. It's based off a dream that the developer had, and the novelization of that story that followed. \n\nThe science of the society in the game followed this line of history, focusing more on an indigenous understanding of the world and life itself. As a result, technology has progressed significantly faster into the realm of quantum physics and mathematics. There is also a significant history of non-european industrialization, leading to some steam-punk elements, as well.\n\nJamata Defense is a tower defense game for mobile devices that was developed by a single developer. \n\nThe developer does not want to use in app purchases, since it seems to be detrimental to some otherwise brilliant games, so there are no in app purchases in this game.\n\nTower Defense Updates\n\nIf you purchase the game, you get all future updates for free. Currently, there are 21 additional levels in production, meaning the final XL version of Jamata Defense will have a total of 42 Levels. These will be free to anyone who purchases the game, as well as any other additions to the game.\n\nIf you enjoy the game, feel free to reach out! \n\nAbout: \n\n* 3d Tower Defense Levels\n* NEW- Block Enemy Paths\n* Endless Play Mode\n* Win Prizes for More Gold and Renown Points\n* Use Renown Points to Slow Enemies\n* Use Renown to Shield Temples\n* Full Map of Jamata for Level Selection\n* Original Music\n* Turn Sound or Music On and Off\n* Optimized for Headphones\n* No Purchases in the Game\n\nI'll try and reach out to people who drop reviews.\n\nHate Ads?

Gotcha is the first new board game to be invented for many years! It mixes ideas cultivated for generations and adds a new twist. Challenge your friends today, and win prizes or coins!\n\nA MESSAGE FROM THE CREATOR OF GOTCHA!\nINTRODUCING GOTCHA! A classic, timeless board game where backgammon, checkers, and chess meet.\n\nI have always loved playing board games my entire life. I grew up in the 60s and 70s, before there was ever such a thing as video games. I loved playing all the classic, iconic games such as Checkers, Chess, Monopoly, Parcheesi, Life, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Mancala and so many others. These were the games that my generation grew up playing, as did my parents\u2019 generation, and generations before them. As much as I loved all those games, I\u2019d have to say my all-time favorite board game was and is to this day, Backgammon. I think what I liked most about playing Backgammon was because it is one of the few games ever invented that provided me with an intellectual challenge, which I could control, as well as subjecting me to the sheer dumb luck of the roll of the dice, over which I had absolutely no control. That rare combination of a game requiring skill, strategy, and luck fascinated me and had me hooked for life. It also provided me with an essential quality that is core to the GOTCHA! experience \u2013 the ability to escape the chaotic pace of daily life for a few moments each day.\n\nGOTCHA! meets all of the standards of the great classic games. It\u2019s easy to learn how to play, the rules are very basic with a couple of fun and interesting twists, and yet it will severely challenge your mind and strategic thinking ability, test your tolerance for risk, and subject you to the pure luck of the roll of the dice. In other words, GOTCHA! pretty much reflects how life works every day. For those of you \u201con the go\u201d, constantly busy types, a single game of GOTCHA! can take as little as 2-3 minutes to play, or it can take 15-20 minutes to play, depending on one\u2019s luck and the skill of the players. If you\u2019re a competitive person like I am, GOTCHA! will get your competitive juices flowing freely each and every time you play, whether you\u2019re just trying to beat the computer or trying to beat your family, friends, or the rest of humankind around the world.\n\nThe original basic concept of GOTCHA came to me in a dream a few years ago (seriously). Now that GOTCHA has become a reality, it is my dream, and my sincere, heartfelt wish that each and every one of you will derive countless hours of enjoyment playing GOTCHA for the rest of your lives. Hopefully you will also pass on the love of playing GOTCHA to your children, their children, and many generations to come. It is my ultimate dream that GOTCHA will someday join the ranks of classic, generational, iconic board games and live on forever.\n\nOk, enough talk, start playing. But before you begin, a word of warning \u2014 GOTCHA is a highly addictive endeavor. Make sure to first complete whatever items are on your To Do List today before playing GOTCHA!, or else you\u2019ll never get anything else done, other than becoming a GOTCHA! guru that much quicker.\n\nHave fun!	0

"A Tale of Sushi\n\nMasao\u2019s sushi restaurant was not doing well.  After the store was closed one day, he made himself a Kapamaki.  He was thinking about closing the business the following week. \n\nJust when he picked up the tiny Kapamaki and was about to put into his mouth, he heard a little voice: \u201dDon\u2019t eat me!  I will make you a lot of money!\u201d  \n\nHe looked around, there was no one there except himself.  Everyone had left.  \n\nHe raised his chopsticks again, and the voice sounded again.  \u201dI promise. I will save your business and make you rich.\u201d  \n\nThis time, he found where the voice came from.  It was the Kapamaki between his chopsticks.  \n\nHe was so amused and asked, \u201dHow will you make me money?  People are becoming vegetarian.  They don\u2019t eat sushi anymore.\u201d  \n\nKapamaki said, \u201dI can run!  I can entertain people so they will all run to your restaurant to watch me run.  You can charge them admission to watch me run.\u201d \n\nMasao said, \u201dReally?\u201d  \n\nKapamaki said, \u201dPut me on the track.  Let me show you.\u201d \n\nNow Masao became curious.  Having nothing better to do, he put the Kapamaki in the track of the sushi river.  \n\nThe tiny Kapamaki tried very hard to run, but he was quite wobbly at first.  After two rounds, he started getting better and better.  \n\nMasao smiled.  \n\nHe said, \u201dIt\'s very nice of you to care about my business and try to help.  But how much can you make?  The rent is expensive.  My chef has to pay his mortgage.\u201d  \n\nKapamaki blinked his eyes.  He said, \u201dIf you make more sushi, we can all make money for you.\u201d  \n\nMasao said, ""That\u2019s easy.""  After all, he was the best sushi master in the whole country.  So he started making another Kapamaki.  \n\nThe first little Kapamaki said, \u201dJoin us together.  We will unite and become bigger, better, and faster!  And we will make you more money.\u201d  \n\nMasao put the two Kapamaki together, and Bang!  They merged to become a new sushi Tekkamaki.  \n\nMasao was so surprised and happy.  He made more and more sushi, and kept on merging them.  The next day, he put a sign outside his restaurant - \u201cMerge Sushi.  Ticket price: $10.\u201d  People felt curious and came in.  They found the sushi racing going on.  People started to put money down, betting which sushi will win.  \n\nWhen more and more people rushed to Masao\'s restaurant to watch sushi racing, Masao\u2019s sushi got an invitation to a talk show to introduce his sushi restaurant. Now people all over the world know about Masao\'s restaurant.  In 2 years, Masao has become a billionaire.  And this all started with a little magical sushi!"	1
